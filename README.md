# MED-PROJECTS-
This repository is a growing collection of projects focused on the intersection of AI, medical imaging, and interactive visualization. Designed for students, researchers, and developers, these projects explore how deep learning and Python-based tools can be used to analyze, segment, and visualize complex anatomical structures in 2D and 3D.
# 3D Organ Segmentation and Visualization

This project visualizes three organs (brain, heart, kidney) in 3D and performs automated segmentation using AI models in Python.

## Features

- 3D visualization using matplotlib/pyvista/plotly/skimage/Nibabel/scipy/Numpy
- Automated segmentation using trained deep learning models
- Organ-specific models
- User-friendly script execution
